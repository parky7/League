<h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Champion Select </h2>
<p> Currently you will see a lot of ad bruisers, and tanks in the top lane, with very 
little "squishy" champions.  This means that champions like Darius, Garen, Jayce, and 
Tryndamere are very good if you don't know what to play.  Although, if you are an 
experienced player it may be easier to go a ranged champion like Quinn, and Teemo, as long
as you are playing at against low levels.  This is because the ranged champions have a lot
of poke against most of the melee bruisers, and you can get ahead early game.  However if 
you don't get ahead it will become increasingly harder to win in the late game.</p>
<p> You must also chose the summoner spells that you want.  It is almost a must that you 
take flash, but your secondary spell should be teleport if you are going top.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Laning Phase</h2>
<p> Usually the lane phase is pretty slow, with little kills, and a focus on cs.  This can
change depending on the matchup though, especially if you are playing a ranged champion, 
also if there are a lot of ganks from the junglers.  You may also want to make a few tp
 ganks in order to help out your teammates. </p>
 <h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Team Fights</h2>
 <p>This is where it becomes helpful to have a tank or a bruiser as your top laner.  
 This can be helpful, because you need to have at least one, but preferably two tanks to 
 help soak up some of the damage, so that your carries don't just die instantly.  
 This is why in the higher skill level, where people target the carries it becomes much 
 harder to pull off a top laner like Quinn or Teemo.  Usually a champion that can dive 
 into the enemy teams back lines, and tank a lot of damage will do well in the later game 
 because it is so team fight orientated, for example Maokai.</p>
