<p>League of Legends is a MOBA, or multiplayer online battle area, in which there are 5 players to 
each team, and the goal is for you to destroy the other teams nexus.  There are 138 different champions 
for you to chose from, each with there own unique abilitys.  Before each game dring the champions
selct each player will pick there champion, with 5 different champions on each team, each of them 
going a different role, either top lane, jungle, mid lane, adc, or support.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Abilitys</h2>

<p> Each champion has 4 different abilitys, and a passive, each player will also chose 2 summoner spells during champion select, in adition to the normal abilitys.
Summoner spells include Flash, Teleport, Ignite, Barrier, Heal, Exaust, Smite, Ghost, and Cleanse.  There abilitys are controled by Q,W,E,and R.
The Passive is something that is usually always affeacting you, where as normal abilitys have 
to be activated. Each time you level up you can choose to upgrade a different ability, with an ultimate
that is upgradeable at level 6, 11, and 16.  Your champion will also gain a stat boost each time you
level up, with the maximum level being 18.</p>
 <h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Champion Select</h2>
 <img src="spells.jpg">
 <p>The champion select is the period before games in which teams figure out who is going which role, and 
 what champions they are playing.  If you are playing blind pick then you will have to call your 
 role in the chat, and hope that you get it first, and you don't know what the enemy team is going
 to play.  When you are playing in draft pick your role wile be assigned to you, based on your primary 
 and secondary roles that you chose prior to queing up.  In draft pick each person gets to ban one
  champion, that they don't want to play against, once everyone on both teams has banned players begin
  to select there champions, swithching from team to team 1 person choses at a time.  After you have 
  chosen your champion you will choose your runes and masteries.</p>
