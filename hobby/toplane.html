<h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > What Champion Should You Pick? </h2>
<p> Currently you will see a lot of ad bruisers, and tanks in the top lane, with very 
little "squishy" champions.  This means that champions like Darius, Garen, Jayce, and 
Tryndamere are very good if you don't know what to play.  Although, if you are an 
experienced player it may be easier to go a ranged champion like Quinn, and Teemo, as long
as you are playing at against low levels.  This is because the ranged champions have a lot
of poke against most of the melee bruisers, and you can get ahead early game.  However if 
you don't get ahead it will become increasingly harder to win in the late game.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Oswald', serif;" > Laning Phase</h2>
<p> Usually the lane phase is pretty slow, with little kills, and a focus on cs.  This can
change depending on the matchup though, especially if you are playing a ranged champion, 
also if there are a lot of ganks from the junglers.  You may also want to make a few tp
 ganks in order to help out your teammates.s </p>
